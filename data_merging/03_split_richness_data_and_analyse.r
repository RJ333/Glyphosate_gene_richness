# in the previous scripts we generated the R object (R workspace "data_merging_glyph_single_assemblies.RData") prokka_all
# and all_products_richness. Now each gene/product should be assigned to a group, depending on its richness change
# to determine which group a gene belongs to, certain conditions must be fulfilled

# cell peak value higher than starting value?
# end value
# average value?


# calculate average richness per product

# check the range from highest to lowest value for all products
